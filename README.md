please launch 'pod install' and launch PhotoViewer.xcworkspace.

I used Kingfisher as image cache library.
I build an photo viewer app with a basic collectionView. I fetch data from a custom framework called PhotoApi.
If I had more time, I would have added search and Api switch to the UI. I fetch 100 picture from Flickr Api.

Would be nice to speak about the project !
